# Nigerian Cultures & Festivals

This website is about Nigerian cultures and festivals from different ethnic groups in Nigeria. 
It showcases different tribes and festivals they love to celebrate.
Festivals means a lot to Nigerians, as many believe it is a time to celebrate what binds them, just as christmas is to Christians or St Patrick's day is to Irish people. 
people travel from all over the world to witness these festivals, it is sometimes also organized by Government to showcase the beauty of who they represent and the lands.
Individuals and groups wanting to take a tour or vacation to Nigeria will find the website very helpful to them.
